## SLCSP Take Home
### Instructions to run script

1. Download the repo and save in a directory of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and cd to the directory this repo was saved in.
3. Run `python main.py` in the terminal.
4. The results should be output in both the terminal and in a new file named "output.csv" in the /files directory.

### Other information

- The "files" directory contains all the CSVs for the take home test.
- There is a `test.py` file, but it is empty as I was not able to get to that in time.
- I left some comments on things I would change, issues I noticed while working on the problem, or explanations on what the code is doing.
